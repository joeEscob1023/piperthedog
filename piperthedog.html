	<h2>Short Story of Piper</h2>

	<p>I adopted Piper in Febuary of 2017. Even after all this time, I still don't know what kind of dog she is. <br> The shelter said she was beaten and abused thoughout her first year of life, but she has found comfort here at her new home.<br> She is sweet, but really skiddish. She doesn't like new people or kids at all.</p>
